## What is this
Sliding Window Technique is a computational technique that aims to <span style="color:blue"><u>reduce the use of nested loops and replace it with a single loop</u></span>, thereby reducing the time complexity.

The use of the Sliding Window technique can be done in a very specific scenario, where <span style="color:blue"><u>the size of the window for computation is fixed</u></span> throughout the complete nested loop. <span style="color:blue"><u>Only then the time complexity can be reduced.</u></span>
